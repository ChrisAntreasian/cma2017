                        <h2>Web development</h2>
                        <p>
                            I have been working as a professional web developer for 10 years, gaining experience with full stack development. The aspect of web developemnt that I find most rewarding is building front ends.
                            Using JavaScript and CSS together they are incredibly powerful tools that I use to build fun interactive user interfaces.
                            Over my career the languages of the web have evolved, at one time jQuery was used to for user interactions and images for rounded corners. Newer tools like ReactJS provides organization and stability to interfaces and many of the older limitations of CSS have been solved.
                            My skills with web technology have grown with these new tools, and many moments that may have proved chalenging in the past are now much more simple.

                            I started my artistic career at a young age, spending hours drawing cartoon characters at my great aunts house.
                            Off and on since the end of high school I have been working on an illustrated novel called the Quintuplapus.
                            It is an adventure story about an octopus, encountering a string of bad luck and challenges.
